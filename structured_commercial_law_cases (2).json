            "and secondly, the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the law in force in India, and thirdly, the award must be made on or after 11th Oct. 1960 and lastly, the award must be in pursuance of an agreement in writing for arbitration to which the New York Convention applies.",
            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",
            "Therefore, when the Parliament used the words \"law in force in India,\" we cannot lose sight of the fact that the use of those words was intended to give effect to the concept of  'law of India' contained in the declaration of accession and to the concept 'national law of the State making a declaration.'",
            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",
            "The New York  Convention mad reference to the national law and the deceleration of accession to the New York convention by India made reference  to the law of  India,  Now.",
            "the words \"national law\"  or \"the law of  India\" no  doubt will  take in a particular  statute,  but these  worse Arbitration of such wide import that they will  envelope the entire body of law which are effective or operative  in India.",
            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",
            "Therefore, when the Parliament used the words \"law in force in India,\" we cannot lose sight of the fact that the use of those words was intended to give effect to the concept of  'law of India' contained in the declaration of accession and to the concept 'national law of the State making a declaration.'",
            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",
            "The New York  Convention mad reference to the national law and the deceleration of accession to the New York convention by India made reference  to the law of  India,  Now.",
            "the words \"national law\"  or \"the law of  India\" no  doubt will  take in a particular  statute,  but these  worse Arbitration of such wide import that they will  envelope the entire body of law which are effective or operative  in India.",
            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "The Law Commission of India, headed by Chief Justice A.P. Shah (Retd.), in its 253rd Report dated 29th January, 2015 submitted to the Law Ministry, proposed a new legislation to deal exclusively with Commercial Disputes.",
            "The Union Law Ministry introduced this Bill in the Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon Session which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee.",
            "The commercial dispute has to be heard by experts with demonstrable expertise than those people having the commercial law because it is not the institution that we are creating.",
            "We have to evolve a transparent method of appointment of judges and appoint those judges having specialised knowledge in commercial law because we are in a globalised economy and specialisation in every subject is very necessary.",
            "Just like the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Foreign Service, Indian Forest Service, Indian Police Service, we can recruit the judges in commercial courts, especially, those who are having knowledge in commercial law.",
            "But if we are recruiting judges having knowledge of general law and not having specialised knowledge of commercial law, then the same situation will arise where it is not the system which would fail us but we will fail the system itself.",
            "By this method, since a large number of Tribunals are there, the cases will automatically be transferred after the coming into force of this Act and the delay which is being caused in the Tribunals like Competition Appellate Tribunal, Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Intellectual Property Rights Appellate Board, Company Law Board, National Company Law Tribunal, Security Appellate Tribunal, Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, will be reduced.",
            "Law Minister is that instead of doing this, we can include all those Acts which are dealing with the commercial disputes.",
            "Law Minister that though the word ‘commercial dispute’ has already been defined, it again needs to be reviewed."

            "The  statement  of  the\n      objects and reasons of the Arbitration  Act,  1996  clearly  indicates\n      that law of arbitration in India at  the  time  of  enactment  of  the\n      Arbitration  Act,  1996,  was   substantially   contained   in   three\n      enactments,  namely,  The  Arbitration  Act,  1940;  The   Arbitration\n      (Protocol  and  Convention)  Act,  1937   and   The   Foreign   Awards\n      (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.",
            "It is  specifically  observed\n      that it is widely felt that the Arbitration Act, 1940, which  contains\n      the general law of arbitration, has become outdated.",
            "It also mentions\n      that the Law Commission of India,  several  representative  bodies  of\n      trade and industry and experts  in  the  fields  of  arbitration  have\n      proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act,  1940,  to  make  it  more\n      responsive to contemporary requirements.",
            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",
            "Paragraph 3 of the statement  of  objects  and\n      reasons makes it clear that  although  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Laws  are\n      intended  to  deal  with  international  commercial  arbitration   and\n      conciliation, they could, with appropriate modifications, serve  as  a\n      Model Law for legislation of domestic  arbitration  and  conciliation.",
            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",
            "The aforesaid Act also seeks to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation and for matters  connected  therewith  or\n      incidental thereto.",
            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",
            "Therefore, the Arbitration Act, 1996 consolidates the law on  domestic\n      arbitrations by incorporating the provisions to  expressly  deal  with\n      the domestic as  well  as  international  commercial  arbitration;  by\n      taking into account the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Laws.",
            "It is also necessary to  appreciate  that\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeks to remove the anomalies  that  existed\n      in the Arbitration Act, 1940 by introducing provisions  based  on  the\n      UNCITRAL  Model  Laws,  which  deals  with  international   commercial\n      arbitrations and also extends it to commercial domestic  arbitrations.",

            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",

            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",
            "Therefore, when the Parliament used the words \"law in force in India,\" we cannot lose sight of the fact that the use of those words was intended to give effect to the concept of  'law of India' contained in the declaration of accession and to the concept 'national law of the State making a declaration.'",
            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",
            "The New York  Convention mad reference to the national law and the deceleration of accession to the New York convention by India made reference  to the law of  India,  Now.",
            "the words \"national law\"  or \"the law of  India\" no  doubt will  take in a particular  statute,  but these  worse Arbitration of such wide import that they will  envelope the entire body of law which are effective or operative  in India.",
            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "With  these  objects  in  view,  the  UNCITRAL   Model   Law   on\n      International Arbitration (“the Model Law”) was adopted by the  United\n      Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on 21st June,\n      1985 at the end of the 18th Session of the  Commission.",
            "The  General\n      Assembly in its      Resolution 40 of  1972  on  11th  December,  1985\n      recommended that \"all States give due consideration to the  Model  Law\n      on international commercial arbitration, in view of  the  desirability\n      of uniformity of the law of arbitral procedures and the specific needs\n      of international commercial arbitration practice\".",
            "Does the missing ‘only’ indicate a deviation from Article 1(2) of  the\n      Model Law?\n       64.",
            "As noticed earlier the objects and reasons for  the  enactment  of\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 clearly indicate  that  the  Parliament  had\n      taken into account the UNCITRAL Model  Laws.",
            "The  statement  of  the\n      objects and reasons of the Arbitration  Act,  1996  clearly  indicates\n      that law of arbitration in India at  the  time  of  enactment  of  the\n      Arbitration  Act,  1996,  was   substantially   contained   in   three\n      enactments,  namely,  The  Arbitration  Act,  1940;  The   Arbitration\n      (Protocol  and  Convention)  Act,  1937   and   The   Foreign   Awards\n      (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.",
            "It is  specifically  observed\n      that it is widely felt that the Arbitration Act, 1940, which  contains\n      the general law of arbitration, has become outdated.",
            "It also mentions\n      that the Law Commission of India,  several  representative  bodies  of\n      trade and industry and experts  in  the  fields  of  arbitration  have\n      proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act,  1940,  to  make  it  more\n      responsive to contemporary requirements.",
            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",
            "Paragraph 3 of the statement  of  objects  and\n      reasons makes it clear that  although  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Laws  are\n      intended  to  deal  with  international  commercial  arbitration   and\n      conciliation, they could, with appropriate modifications, serve  as  a\n      Model Law for legislation of domestic  arbitration  and  conciliation.",
            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",
            "The aforesaid Act also seeks to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation and for matters  connected  therewith  or\n      incidental thereto.",
            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",
            "Therefore, the Arbitration Act, 1996 consolidates the law on  domestic\n      arbitrations by incorporating the provisions to  expressly  deal  with\n      the domestic as  well  as  international  commercial  arbitration;  by\n      taking into account the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Laws.",
            "It is also necessary to  appreciate  that\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeks to remove the anomalies  that  existed\n      in the Arbitration Act, 1940 by introducing provisions  based  on  the\n      UNCITRAL  Model  Laws,  which  deals  with  international   commercial\n      arbitrations and also extends it to commercial domestic  arbitrations.",

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",

            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",

            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",

            "The  statement  of  the\n      objects and reasons of the Arbitration  Act,  1996  clearly  indicates\n      that law of arbitration in India at  the  time  of  enactment  of  the\n      Arbitration  Act,  1996,  was   substantially   contained   in   three\n      enactments,  namely,  The  Arbitration  Act,  1940;  The   Arbitration\n      (Protocol  and  Convention)  Act,  1937   and   The   Foreign   Awards\n      (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.",
            "It is  specifically  observed\n      that it is widely felt that the Arbitration Act, 1940, which  contains\n      the general law of arbitration, has become outdated.",
            "It also mentions\n      that the Law Commission of India,  several  representative  bodies  of\n      trade and industry and experts  in  the  fields  of  arbitration  have\n      proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act,  1940,  to  make  it  more\n      responsive to contemporary requirements.",
            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",

            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",
            "The aforesaid Act also seeks to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation and for matters  connected  therewith  or\n      incidental thereto.",
            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",
            "Therefore, when the Parliament used the words \"law in force in India,\" we cannot lose sight of the fact that the use of those words was intended to give effect to the concept of  'law of India' contained in the declaration of accession and to the concept 'national law of the State making a declaration.'",
            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",
            "The New York  Convention mad reference to the national law and the deceleration of accession to the New York convention by India made reference  to the law of  India,  Now.",
            "the words \"national law\"  or \"the law of  India\" no  doubt will  take in a particular  statute,  but these  worse Arbitration of such wide import that they will  envelope the entire body of law which are effective or operative  in India.",
            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",
            "Therefore, when the Parliament used the words \"law in force in India,\" we cannot lose sight of the fact that the use of those words was intended to give effect to the concept of  'law of India' contained in the declaration of accession and to the concept 'national law of the State making a declaration.'",
            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",
            "The New York  Convention mad reference to the national law and the deceleration of accession to the New York convention by India made reference  to the law of  India,  Now.",
            "the words \"national law\"  or \"the law of  India\" no  doubt will  take in a particular  statute,  but these  worse Arbitration of such wide import that they will  envelope the entire body of law which are effective or operative  in India.",
            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "The  General\n      Assembly in its      Resolution 40 of  1972  on  11th  December,  1985\n      recommended that \"all States give due consideration to the  Model  Law\n      on international commercial arbitration, in view of  the  desirability\n      of uniformity of the law of arbitral procedures and the specific needs\n      of international commercial arbitration practice\".",
            "Does the missing ‘only’ indicate a deviation from Article 1(2) of  the\n      Model Law?\n       64.",
            "As noticed earlier the objects and reasons for  the  enactment  of\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 clearly indicate  that  the  Parliament  had\n      taken into account the UNCITRAL Model  Laws.",
            "The  statement  of  the\n      objects and reasons of the Arbitration  Act,  1996  clearly  indicates\n      that law of arbitration in India at  the  time  of  enactment  of  the\n      Arbitration  Act,  1996,  was   substantially   contained   in   three\n      enactments,  namely,  The  Arbitration  Act,  1940;  The   Arbitration\n      (Protocol  and  Convention)  Act,  1937   and   The   Foreign   Awards\n      (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.",
            "It is  specifically  observed\n      that it is widely felt that the Arbitration Act, 1940, which  contains\n      the general law of arbitration, has become outdated.",
            "It also mentions\n      that the Law Commission of India,  several  representative  bodies  of\n      trade and industry and experts  in  the  fields  of  arbitration  have\n      proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act,  1940,  to  make  it  more\n      responsive to contemporary requirements.",
            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",
            "Paragraph 3 of the statement  of  objects  and\n      reasons makes it clear that  although  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Laws  are\n      intended  to  deal  with  international  commercial  arbitration   and\n      conciliation, they could, with appropriate modifications, serve  as  a\n      Model Law for legislation of domestic  arbitration  and  conciliation.",
            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",
            "The aforesaid Act also seeks to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation and for matters  connected  therewith  or\n      incidental thereto.",
            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",
            "Therefore, the Arbitration Act, 1996 consolidates the law on  domestic\n      arbitrations by incorporating the provisions to  expressly  deal  with\n      the domestic as  well  as  international  commercial  arbitration;  by\n      taking into account the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Laws.",
            "It is also necessary to  appreciate  that\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeks to remove the anomalies  that  existed\n      in the Arbitration Act, 1940 by introducing provisions  based  on  the\n      UNCITRAL  Model  Laws,  which  deals  with  international   commercial\n      arbitrations and also extends it to commercial domestic  arbitrations.",

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",

            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",

            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "It is  specifically  observed\n      that it is widely felt that the Arbitration Act, 1940, which  contains\n      the general law of arbitration, has become outdated.",
            "It also mentions\n      that the Law Commission of India,  several  representative  bodies  of\n      trade and industry and experts  in  the  fields  of  arbitration  have\n      proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act,  1940,  to  make  it  more\n      responsive to contemporary requirements.",
            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",

            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",

            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",
            "Therefore, when the Parliament used the words \"law in force in India,\" we cannot lose sight of the fact that the use of those words was intended to give effect to the concept of  'law of India' contained in the declaration of accession and to the concept 'national law of the State making a declaration.'",
            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",
            "The New York  Convention mad reference to the national law and the deceleration of accession to the New York convention by India made reference  to the law of  India,  Now.",
            "the words \"national law\"  or \"the law of  India\" no  doubt will  take in a particular  statute,  but these  worse Arbitration of such wide import that they will  envelope the entire body of law which are effective or operative  in India.",
            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",
            "The proposition laid down by the learned Judge cannot be disputed, However,  when the learned Judge  proceeding to construe the provision in S. 2 of the 1916 Act the emphasised the use of the words \"under the law in force in India\" and then observed  as follows in para 41:--"

            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",
            "Paragraph 3 of the statement  of  objects  and\n      reasons makes it clear that  although  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Laws  are\n      intended  to  deal  with  international  commercial  arbitration   and\n      conciliation, they could, with appropriate modifications, serve  as  a\n      Model Law for legislation of domestic  arbitration  and  conciliation.",
            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",
            "The aforesaid Act also seeks to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation and for matters  connected  therewith  or\n      incidental thereto.",
            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",
            "Therefore, the Arbitration Act, 1996 consolidates the law on  domestic\n      arbitrations by incorporating the provisions to  expressly  deal  with\n      the domestic as  well  as  international  commercial  arbitration;  by\n      taking into account the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Laws.",
            "It is also necessary to  appreciate  that\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeks to remove the anomalies  that  existed\n      in the Arbitration Act, 1940 by introducing provisions  based  on  the\n      UNCITRAL  Model  Laws,  which  deals  with  international   commercial\n      arbitrations and also extends it to commercial domestic  arbitrations.",
            "UNCITRAL  Model  Law  has  unequivocally  accepted   the   territorial\n      principle."

            "The definition will show that when it referred to \"legal relationship ............. considered as commercial under the law in force in India\".",
            "it was intended to give effect to the declaration in the Convention that the legal relationship must be considered as commercial under the national law of the State making the declaration and in terms of the accession of India to the New York Convention.",
            "The declaration was that the legal relationship, whether contractual or not, was to be such as is considered as commercial under the law of India.",

            "Mr. Nariman appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended that when the definition of foreign award uses the phraseology \"considered as commercial under the law in force in India,\" it has merely to be ascertained whether a legal relationship is regarded by law as commercial or whether a legal relationship is recognised in law as commercial and, according to the learned Counsel, it was not necessary to enact any particular statute, as seems to be contemplated by the decision in Indian Organic Chemicals Ltd.'s case  which would specify or indicate what legal  relationships were to be commercial for the purposes of the 1961 Act.",
            "the contention is that if under the general law of the land, a particular relationship was considered as commercial in the normal sense of the term.",
            "Now, when the definition of foreign award  refers to \"legal relationships ............... considered  as commercial under the law in force in India:\" we cannot overlook the fact that the 1961  Act was intended to give effect to the New York Convention.",

            "Indeed when the statute uses the words \"law in force  in  India\"  such use of words could never have contemplated a reference to any particular law and while it may in a given case in the context refer to a law on that particular subject, generally such words  are used  when reference is made to the general body of laws  operative  in India.",
            "We have repeatedly asked  the learned Counsel for the  intervene and the respondent as to what kind of provision they contemplate which they argued that there has to be a law which deals with contractual legal relationships and declares them to be commercial.",
            "With   several kinds of transactions which may be considered as commercial on the facts of each case, it is obvious that when the parliament referred  to the legal relationships considered as commercial under the  law in force in India.",
            "it  had in mind the general body of laws with reference to which the nature of the transaction would be considered.",
            "The  nature of the relationships will depend   in the nature of the transaction and whether the nature of the  transaction is commercial or not will have  to be determined with reference generally to the law  in force in the country  inclusive of what  the learned Judge, who decided the Indian Organic chemicals Ltd.'s case  referred to as an operative legal principle  in force in India.",
            "The mean  use of the words 'under preceding  the words  \"law in force in India\"  would not, in our view, necessarily mean that you  have to find a statutory provision or a provision of law which specifically deals with the subject of particular legal relationships being commercial in  nature.",

            "The Law Commission of India, headed by Chief Justice A.P. Shah (Retd.), in its 253rd Report dated 29th January, 2015 submitted to the Law Ministry, proposed a new legislation to deal exclusively with Commercial Disputes.",
            "The Union Law Ministry introduced this Bill in the Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon Session which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee.",
            "The commercial dispute has to be heard by experts with demonstrable expertise than those people having the commercial law because it is not the institution that we are creating.",
            "We have to evolve a transparent method of appointment of judges and appoint those judges having specialised knowledge in commercial law because we are in a globalised economy and specialisation in every subject is very necessary.",
            "Just like the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Foreign Service, Indian Forest Service, Indian Police Service, we can recruit the judges in commercial courts, especially, those who are having knowledge in commercial law.",
            "But if we are recruiting judges having knowledge of general law and not having specialised knowledge of commercial law, then the same situation will arise where it is not the system which would fail us but we will fail the system itself.",
            "By this method, since a large number of Tribunals are there, the cases will automatically be transferred after the coming into force of this Act and the delay which is being caused in the Tribunals like Competition Appellate Tribunal, Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Intellectual Property Rights Appellate Board, Company Law Board, National Company Law Tribunal, Security Appellate Tribunal, Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, will be reduced.",
            "Law Minister is that instead of doing this, we can include all those Acts which are dealing with the commercial disputes.",
            "Law Minister that though the word ‘commercial dispute’ has already been defined, it again needs to be reviewed."

            "The  statement  of  the\n      objects and reasons of the Arbitration  Act,  1996  clearly  indicates\n      that law of arbitration in India at  the  time  of  enactment  of  the\n      Arbitration  Act,  1996,  was   substantially   contained   in   three\n      enactments,  namely,  The  Arbitration  Act,  1940;  The   Arbitration\n      (Protocol  and  Convention)  Act,  1937   and   The   Foreign   Awards\n      (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.",
            "It is  specifically  observed\n      that it is widely felt that the Arbitration Act, 1940, which  contains\n      the general law of arbitration, has become outdated.",
            "It also mentions\n      that the Law Commission of India,  several  representative  bodies  of\n      trade and industry and experts  in  the  fields  of  arbitration  have\n      proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act,  1940,  to  make  it  more\n      responsive to contemporary requirements.",
            "It was also recognized  that\n      the economic reforms initiated by India at that time  may  not  become\n      fully effective, if the law dealing with settlement of  both  domestic\n      and international commercial dispute remained out of  tune  with  such\n      reforms.",
            "The objects and reasons  further  make  it  clear  that  the\n      general  assembly  has  recommended  that  all  countries   give   due\n      consideration to the Model Law adopted in 1985, by  the  UNCITRAL,  in\n      view of  the  desirability  of  uniformity  of  the  law  of  arbitral\n      procedures  and  the  specific  needs  of   international   commercial\n      arbitration practice.",
            "Paragraph 3 of the statement  of  objects  and\n      reasons makes it clear that  although  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Laws  are\n      intended  to  deal  with  international  commercial  arbitration   and\n      conciliation, they could, with appropriate modifications, serve  as  a\n      Model Law for legislation of domestic  arbitration  and  conciliation.",
            "Therefore, the bill was introduced seeking to  consolidate  and  amend\n      the law relating to  domestic  arbitration,  international  commercial\n      arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation, taking into account the  UNCITRAL  Model\n      Law and Rules.",
            "Whilst interpreting the provisions of the Arbitration  Act,  1996,\n      it is necessary to remember that we are dealing  with  the  Act  which\n      seeks  to  consolidate  and  amend  the  law  relating   to   domestic\n      arbitration, international commercial arbitration and  enforcement  of\n      foreign arbitral awards.",
            "The aforesaid Act also seeks to  define  the\n      law relating to conciliation and for matters  connected  therewith  or\n      incidental thereto.",
            "The\n      domestic  law  of  arbitration  had  remained   static   since   1940.",
            "Therefore, the Arbitration Act, 1996 consolidates the law on  domestic\n      arbitrations by incorporating the provisions to  expressly  deal  with\n      the domestic as  well  as  international  commercial  arbitration;  by\n      taking into account the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Laws.",
            "It is also necessary to  appreciate  that\n      the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeks to remove the anomalies  that  existed\n      in the Arbitration Act, 1940 by introducing provisions  based  on  the\n      UNCITRAL  Model  Laws,  which  deals  with  international   commercial\n      arbitrations and also extends it to commercial domestic  arbitrations.",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

        "Summary": "            The Commercial Court vide an ex parte ad interim Order dated\n\n      15.12.2017 directed status-quo to be maintained with respect to the\n\n      enforcement of the Bank Guarantee.\n 1.7         Indo Unique filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and\n\n      Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Arbitration Act”) in Civil (Commercial) Suit No.62 of\n\n      2017, seeking reference of disputes to arbitration.\n\n             Global Mercantile opposed the application under Section 8 as being\n\n      not maintainable since the Bank Guarantee was a separate and\n\n      independent contract, and did not contain any arbitration clause.\n\n1.8         The Commercial Court vide Order dated 18.01.2018 rejected the\n\n      application under Section 8, and held that the arbitration clause in the Work\n\n      Order dated 28.09.2015 was not a general arbitration clause, which would\n\n      cover the Bank Guarantee. The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

        "Summary": "                         A.S. Bopanna,J.\n \n                               Leave granted.\n                          2.   The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P.

With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified.

The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

        "Summary": "                         A.S. Bopanna,J.\n \n                               Leave granted.\n                          2.   The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified.

The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Commercial Law Case",
        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

        "Summary": "                         A.S. Bopanna,J.\n \n                               Leave granted.\n                          2.   The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",

        "Summary": "5.   On 21.12.2017, the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram allowed the\n\n     application of the Petitioner, and returned the Section 34 petition for\n\n     presentation to the proper court having jurisdiction in New Delhi. On\n\n     15.02.2018, the Respondent filed an appeal under Section 37 of the\n\n     Arbitration Act, 1996 read with Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\n\n     Chandigarh. On 12.09.2018, the impugned judgment was delivered\n\n     by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in which it was held that the\n\n     appeal filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was main-\n\n     tainable, and that Delhi being only a convenient venue where arbitral\n\n     proceedings were held and not the seat of the arbitration proceed-\n\n     ings, Faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of\n\n     action having arisen in part in Faridabad. As a result, the appeal was\n\n     allowed and the judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Guru-\n\n     gram was set aside.\n 12. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as follows:\n\n              vision of that High Court within a period of sixty\n             days from the date of the judgment of order:\n 16. This provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbi-\n\n    tration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of fil-\n\n    ing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n\n    awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judg-\n\n    ment is the words “under Section 34”. Thus, the refusal to set aside\n\n    an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set\n\n    out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question,\n\n    and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on\n\n    the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34\n\n    of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n\n\n\nCommercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under\n\n    Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the\n\n    Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to pro-\n\n    ceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such ap-\n\n    plication would have to be returned to the competent court situate at\n\n    New Delhi.\n",

        "Summary": "            The Commercial Court vide an ex parte ad interim Order dated\n\n      15.12.2017 directed status-quo to be maintained with respect to the\n\n      enforcement of the Bank Guarantee.\n 1.7         Indo Unique filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and\n\n      Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Arbitration Act”) in Civil (Commercial) Suit No.62 of\n\n      2017, seeking reference of disputes to arbitration.\n\n             Global Mercantile opposed the application under Section 8 as being\n\n      not maintainable since the Bank Guarantee was a separate and\n\n      independent contract, and did not contain any arbitration clause.\n\n1.8         The Commercial Court vide Order dated 18.01.2018 rejected the\n\n      application under Section 8, and held that the arbitration clause in the Work\n\n      Order dated 28.09.2015 was not a general arbitration clause, which would\n\n      cover the Bank Guarantee. The Bank Guarantee was an independent\n\n      contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the\n\n      contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither\n\n      of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015,\n\n      and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not\n\n      ousted by the arbitration agreement.\n 1.9         Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the\n\n      Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court.\n\n             On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil\n\n      Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the\n\n\n\n\f       withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under\n\n       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\n 1.10         Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High\n\n       Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the\n\n       Commercial Court/District Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil (Commercial) Suit\n\n       No.62/2017.\n              The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held\n\n       that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement\n\n       between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was\n\n       maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank\n\n       Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not\n\n       constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous\n\n       evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing\n\n       of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial\nCourt was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in\n\n       the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities.\n\n",

        "Summary": "                         A.S. Bopanna,J.\n \n                               Leave granted.\n                          2.   The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial\nCourt Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial\nCourt at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed\n\n                         as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being\n\n                         notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written\n\n\n\n                         statement inter alia contending that the suit is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed\n\n\n\fas a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section\n\n2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (“CC Act,\n\n2015” for short).        In view of such contention, the\n\nrespondents herein also filed an application under Order\n\nVII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order\n\nto return the plaint to be presented in the Court in\n\nwhich the suit should have been instituted.              The\n\nappellant herein though did not choose to file objection\n\nto the said application, had however opposed the same.\n\nThe application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the\n\nlearned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration\n\nhad through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the\n\napplication.     The respondents herein claiming to be\n\naggrieved by the said order had approached the High\n\nCourt   of     Gujarat   in   R/Special   Civil   Application\n\nNo.17868/2018.       The High Court through a detailed\n\norder dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set\n\naside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the\n\nCommercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the\n\napplication filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed\n\nthat the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be\n\n\n\n\fpresented in the Court in which the suit should have\n\nbeen instituted.      The appellant    herein,   therefore,\n\nclaiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019\n\nis before this Court in this appeal.\n    “Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c)\n   the dispute can be said to be “commercial dispute” for\n   which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is\n   required to be noted that before the learned Commercial\nCourt the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii)\n   and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned\n   Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has\n   candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not\n   fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned\n   Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the\n   original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii)\n   of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we\n   have considered on merits whether even considering section\n   2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between\n   the parties can be said to be “commercial dispute” within\n   the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act\n   or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), “commercial dispute”\n   means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating\n   to immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of\n   the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable\n   property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot\n   be said to be agreements relating to immovable property\n   used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the\n   agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease\n   from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter\n   developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after\n   providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it,\n   the same is required to be given to other persons like the\n\n\n\f   original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to\n   provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots\n   and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the\n   agreement has been filed. There are other alternative\n   prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n   agreement is as such relating to immovable property used\n   exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of\n   the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the\n   pharseology used is not “actually used” or “being used” and\n   therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if\n   it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also,\n   section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the\n   Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid\n   has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while\n   interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal\n   and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted\n   that important words used in the relevant provisions are\n   “immovable property used exclusively in trade or\n   commerce”. If the submission on behalf of the original\n   plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding\n   something in the statute which is not there in the statute,\n   which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant\n   clause it is clear that the expression “used” must mean\n   “actually used” or “being used”. If the intention of the\n   legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the\n   phraseology used would have been different as for example,\n   “likely to be used” or “to be used”. The word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and it cannot be said to be either “ready for\n   use” or “likely to be used”; or “to be used”. Similar view has\n   been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in\n   the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and\n   it is observed and held that the word “used” denotes\n   “actually used” and not merely “ready for use”. It is\n   reported that SLP against the said decision has been\n   dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\fconstituted with respect to area over which the High Courts have\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction. Section 5(1) of the Act provides for\n\nthe constitution of Commercial Appellate Division having one or\n\nmore Division Benches for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and\n\npowers conferred on it by the Act.\n 5.    Section 6 deals with the jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n\nSection 6 of the Act reads as under:-\n (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is\n\n\n\n\flikely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same\n\ncannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial\nCourt.\n \n 25.   In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah\n\n2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted\n\nfor declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores\n\nexecuted by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of\n\nrespondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent\n\ninjunction   with   respect    to   the    land    in   question.   The\n\nappellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed,\n\nit has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to\n\nimmovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to\n\nbe transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said\n\napplication which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of\n\nestablishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and\n\nCommercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that\n\nthe cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of\n\nexpeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such\n\n\n\n\fa suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or\n\nis dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the\n\nCommercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any\n\ndifference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial\n\nDivision/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of\n\nthe Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated.\n\n\n",
